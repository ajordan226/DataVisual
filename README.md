# Data Visualization Final Project
This project gave us the opportunity to think creatively about how to collect and represent a simple dataset. Our group decided upon a sneaker dataset provided by Stockx, an online marketplace for sneakers and apparel. The data consists of random samples of Off-White and Yeezy sales between September 2017 and February 2019. The sales total up to 99,956 with 27,794 being  Off-White sales and 72,162 being Yeezy.
